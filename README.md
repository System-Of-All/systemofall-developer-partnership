# SALL Token — Developer Partnership Program

The **SALL Token Developer Partnership Program** defines the structured participation framework for technical contributors within the **System Of All ecosystem**.

This repository governs how developers, researchers, and infrastructure specialists may contribute to the ecosystem in a transparent, governed, and contribution-based manner.

> Participation is contribution-driven. It is not investment-driven, promotional, or speculative in nature.





## Program Position Within the Ecosystem

This repository operates under the constitutional and governance framework defined in:

- **System Of All — The One Core**  
- **System Of All — Ecosystem (ARCHITECTURE.md & DECISIONS.md)**  
- **SALL Token repository**

Architectural authority remains centralized at the ecosystem level.  
Nothing in this repository supersedes ecosystem governance.





## Program Overview

The program is designed to:

- Align contributors with ecosystem architecture and governance standards  
- Establish measurable contribution pathways  
- Provide structured recognition mechanisms  
- Maintain interoperability, auditability, and system integrity  

This repository does not constitute a contract, offer, or solicitation.  
Formal engagements occur only through separate written agreements when applicable.





## Who Can Participate

The program is intended for individuals or teams with verifiable technical or domain expertise in areas including:

- Software engineering  
- Blockchain protocol design  
- Security research and auditing  
- Infrastructure engineering and DevOps  
- AI/ML systems  
- Governance architecture  
- Economic mechanism modeling  
- Technical documentation and research  

Participation is based on demonstrated capability and meaningful contribution.

Not eligible:

- Passive participants  
- Promoters or marketing affiliates  
- Capital allocators acting solely as investors  
- Media or publicity roles  





## Nature of Participation & Roles

Participants may engage as:

- **Technical Contributors** — delivering code, infrastructure, or research  
- **Specialist Advisors** — providing domain-specific expertise  
- **Infrastructure Partners** — supporting system stability and scalability  

Expectations include:

- Delivering verifiable outputs  
- Maintaining professional execution standards  
- Operating within defined contribution scope  
- Respecting governance and review processes  

Public representation of participation requires explicit authorization.





## Contribution & Token Alignment

The SALL token functions as a coordination and incentive mechanism within the ecosystem.

Key principles:

- Token allocation is earned through verified contribution  
- Participation is milestone-driven  
- Distribution terms are defined case-by-case  
- Allocation does not automatically confer governance control or ownership rights  
- All arrangements must align with ecosystem governance and applicable compliance standards  

Token participation is subordinate to architectural authority.





## Program Lifecycle

Participation follows a structured sequence:

1. Review ecosystem structure and this repository  
2. Identify relevant contribution track  
3. Engage in scope alignment discussion  
4. Submit contribution proposal or application  
5. Undergo governance review  
6. Execute formal agreement if required  
7. Deliver milestones  
8. Receive recognition or allocation where applicable  

Participation may end at any stage without obligation unless formal agreements are executed.





## Core Principles

- **Architecture First** — Contributions must conform to ARCHITECTURE.md  
- **Governed Review** — All meaningful changes undergo structured review  
- **Merit-Based Recognition** — Impact and quality determine recognition  
- **Transparency** — Decisions are documented and auditable  
- **Interoperability** — No contribution may fragment ecosystem structure  





## Confidentiality & Professional Conduct

Participants agree to:

- Treat non-public information as confidential  
- Use materials solely for contribution-related purposes  
- Represent skills and affiliations accurately  
- Avoid unauthorized public statements regarding token or partnership matters  

All contributors must comply with:

- IP_POLICY.md  
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
