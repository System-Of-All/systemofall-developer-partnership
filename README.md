# System Of All Developer Partnership Program

The official developer partnership and contributor program for the **System Of All** ecosystem.

This repository defines structured pathways for builders, researchers, and technical contributors to participate in the development and evolution of System Of All infrastructure, platforms, and initiatives.

## Purpose

This program exists to:

- Establish clear contribution pathways for developers and researchers
- Recognize and elevate meaningful contributions
- Maintain architectural coherence across the ecosystem
- Enable collaboration under governed, transparent frameworks

## Relationship to System Of All

This partnership program operates under the governance of the **System Of All ecosystem** and aligns with the principles defined in **The One Core**.

- **The One Core** — Defines universal principles and global architecture
- **System Of All Ecosystem** — Defines organizational structure and execution layers
- **This Program** — Defines contributor engagement and recognition frameworks

Contributors do not define architecture. Contributors execute within architecture.
