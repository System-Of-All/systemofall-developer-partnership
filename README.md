## Program Overview

The SALL Token Partnership Program is designed to:

- Align contributors with the **technical, operational, and governance standards** of the SALL ecosystem.  
- Emphasize **measurable contribution, accountability, and long-term system quality**.  
- Provide a clear framework **prior to any formal agreements**.

> **Important:** This program is **not a contract or investment offer**. Any formal engagement, including token allocations, occurs through separate written agreements executed after mutual agreement.



## Who Can Participate

The program is for **individuals or teams with verifiable skills and active contribution capacity** in areas such as:

- Software development and engineering  
- Security research and auditing  
- Blockchain architecture and protocol design  
- AI/ML and data infrastructure  
- Compliance and regulatory frameworks  
- Platform infrastructure & DevOps  
- Tokenomics & economic mechanism design  
- Governance & DAO frameworks  
- Documentation and technical research  

**Not eligible:** Investors, brokers, promoters, influencers, media figures, or passive participants.  

Selection is based on **capability and contribution**, not on capital, network, or promotion.



## Nature of Participation & Roles

Participants engage as:

- **Contributors:** Deliver technical, operational, or research outputs.  
- **Specialists/Advisors:** Provide domain-specific guidance.  
- **Infrastructure Partners:** Support stability, scalability, and security of the ecosystem.  

**Expectations:**

- Deliver verifiable contributions within the defined scope  
- Maintain professional standards, execution quality, and accountability  
- Avoid public promotion, token solicitation, or investor engagement unless explicitly authorized  



## Token Participation & Milestones

- Token allocation is **earned through contribution**, not purchased.  
- Participation is **milestone-driven**; token distribution depends on delivery quality and scope.  
- Allocation, vesting, and other economic terms are **case-by-case** and linked to measurable contribution.  

> The program does **not automatically confer token ownership or rights**. Any token-related arrangements are formalized only through separate written agreements and aligned with compliance requirements.
